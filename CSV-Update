                #TODO - open player's csv file and add new headings to the first row (i.e. "FPTs","B2B", "3in4",	"TmSTK",	"HTRK", "PPFM"
                      - the idea is to use the info that I already have to create these new columns/data.  I feel that treating the csv
                      files like a dictionary and adding new keys would be the way to go, but not sure how to do that.


Here's the shortest way to add a header line to a file:

open("outfile", "w").write("header,line,goes,here\n" + open("infile").read())

Now, there's a copy of the file that may need to be renamed.
